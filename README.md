Project Summary: Novelists, poets, dramatists and script-writers produce thousands of lines of text without ever being paid. We want to bring them to the Near community and help them create their NFT’s, self-organize and find new ways of monetizing their work.

Starting with Lisbon, and then reaching out to every place where someone writes in portuguese, be it a novel, a play, a script or any other form of literary creation, we want to bring in writers and help them be a part of this rapidly changing new world of web 3.

What we want to do:

We want to serve as a gateway for writers from all the portuguese speaking world (Angola, Brasil, Cabo Verde, Guiné-Bissau, Moçambique, Portugal, São Tomé e Príncipe, Timor Leste, Guiné Equatorial) to enter the NEAR community and use its tools.

We want to bring in specialists and organize workshops on topics such as cryptocurrencies, governance, NFT making and networking. We want writers to be able to grasp and evolve in the web 3 world.

We want to be inclusive and foster an ecosystem where writers in all stages of their careers and provenance have a place to share their work and talk on important matters.

We want to implement a system of p2p reviews, feedback and community-driven creative hubs, where aspiring writers and students can meet established writers, each other, and grow.

This things will allow us to strengthen the literary community online and without barriers, help writers imagine news ways of monetizing literary work, of finding new audiences, new public and new partnerships.

The NEAR ecosystem and the crypto space in general can help artists from all languages and métiers to bypass the establishment and reinvent the world. We really believe there is room to grow, and maybe we will serve as an example for other languages, and other communities.
